                        <h2>Monica Levine</h2>
                        <p>
                            Monica is a disciplined military commander. She started her career as a medical officer, but has since rapidly risen through the ranks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In combat, Monica can readily adapt to fill whatever combat role she needs to. Her heavy armor grants her more than enough defense to hold the front line. 
                            And with the ability to use both fire and water magic, she can easily switch between dealing damage and healing her allies as the situation demands. To 
                            top it all off, her sword <i>(while being a fearsome weapon in its own right)</i> also significantly amplifies her magical power.

                        <h2>Jason Lawfree</h2>
                        <p>
                            Jason, a childhood friend of Monica's, is a skilled engineer who specializes in building experimental weapons and armor. 
                            He never thought he'd be using the equipment he designed, but fate seemingly had other plans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In combat, what Jason lacks in physical strength he more than makes up for with speed. His reflexes <i>(enhanced by his electric magic)</i> 
                            are second to none, and he's often the first to notice a pattern in enemy behavior thanks to his keen intellect. He can also use his magic 
                            to further boost his agility and generate shields to bolster his defenses, making him an ideal interceptor.
                        </p>
